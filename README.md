# MedicoActivity Website Deployment Guide

Your domain `medicoactivity.com` is currently showing a Hostinger parking page because the website files haven't been uploaded yet.

## Quick Fix Options:

### Option 1: GitHub Pages (Free & Easy)
1. Run: `./deploy-github.sh`
2. Create a public GitHub repository
3. Push the generated files
4. Enable GitHub Pages
5. Set custom domain to `medicoactivity.com`
6. Update DNS settings at Hostinger

### Option 2: Upload to Hostinger
1. Log into your Hostinger account
2. Go to File Manager
3. Upload `index-fixed.html` as `index.html`
4. Your styled website will be live immediately

## Files Ready for Deployment:

- **`index-fixed.html`** - Complete styled website (self-contained)
- **`index.html`** - Alternative version
- **`deploy-github.sh`** - Automated GitHub Pages setup

## Why Your Site Shows No Styling:

The current `medicoactivity.com` is just Hostinger's default parking page. None of your beautiful website files are uploaded yet.

## DNS Configuration for GitHub Pages:

If using GitHub Pages with custom domain:
1. Add CNAME record: `medicoactivity.com` â†’ `yourusername.github.io`
2. Add A records pointing to GitHub Pages IPs:
   - 185.199.108.153
   - 185.199.109.153
   - 185.199.110.153
   - 185.199.111.153

Your styled website with medical blue/green theme, forms, and all functionality is ready to deploy!
